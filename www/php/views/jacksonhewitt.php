                    <p>To get Jackson Hewitt chosen, we needed to make their site friendlier to visitors. So we reimagined the site to streamlined the experience while also delivering more of what mattered to people. We created localized landing pages and optimized content for mobile, making the site more engaging while being more intuitive. It led to some beautiful numbers.</p>
